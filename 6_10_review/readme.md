# Schwab Market Perspective
Mny have been confounded by the stock market's surge since March 23rd amid less-than-rosy U.S. economic data. That disconnect narowed on THursday, as jitters about a potential second wave of COVI-19 infections, along with a grim economic outlook from the Federal Reserve - drove investors out of riskier assets and led to a 5.9% drop in the S&P 500 index.

Ongoing volatility underscores the precariousness of the recent rally. Even as the S&P 500 index rallied to recoup much of hte losses made since its March 23rd low, we have cautioned that a second wave of coronavirus cases could upend invester confidence, raising the prospect of a fresh round of social-distancing restrictions or layoffs.

## U.S. stocks and economy: Mixed signals
In recent weeks, the gap between economists' estimates and actual May U.S. payroll gains caused Citi's Economic Surpirse Index to spike. The series, which measures data surprises relative to market expectations, has recovered from its deep plunge into negative territory, confirming that data in the pst wek have continued to come in better than anticipated - although remaining very week in absolute terms.
在最近几个礼拜中， 美国五月份收入数据上升同经济学家的预期之间大差距让花旗银行金融意外指数大跌眼镜（又要甩锅经济学家么）。这个统计相对市场预期实际数据带来的意外指数从3月份的低谷中渐渐恢复，证实了过去一周的数据保持良好的表现，虽然从客观的角度说还是较为弱势（摸棱两可的判断，只挑安全的话讲）。

The rub with the recent uptick is that the unexpectedly strong May jobs report - in which payrolls gained 2.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate declined to 13.3% - alone constituted most of the surge into positive territory. In other words, positive surprises reflected extremly low expectations, not a meaningful improvement in the growth rate of the economy. The hole from which the economy has to emerge - however narrow - is deep enough to suggest market-based enthusiasm about a shartp recovery may have been unfounded.
最近上升的问题是，5月就业报告出人意料地强劲，其中就业人数增加250万，失业率下降到13.3%，仅此一项就构成了向积极领域激增的大部分（Fed都出来说报告数据不实了）。换句话说，积极的意外反映了原先极低的预期，而不是经济增长的有意义的改善。经济将要出现的缺口————无论多么狭窄————已经足够表明市场对于快速复苏的热情可能是毫无根据的（听说美股有缺口必补）。

As US stocks rallied off the March lows, measures of investor sentiment followed suit; with some behavioral measures showing signs of excessive optimism and even forth, and attitudinal measures starting to signal complacency.
随着美国股市从3月份的低点反弹，投资者情绪也随之上扬；一些行为指标显示过度乐观甚至鸡犬升天的迹象。

As you can see in the chart below, Ned Davis Research's Crowd Sentiment Pool - a reflection of various sentiment indicators - has merged out of the 'extreme pessimism' zone and, as of June 9th, climbed well into extreme optimism territory. Extremes were also seen in options trading (as per recent findings by SentimenTrader) and huge spikes in hyped-up bankruptcy stocks' prices(as per Bloomberg).
正如下图所示，Ned Davis Research的大众情绪池————反映各种情绪指标的指数————已经从“极端悲观”区合并，在6月9号为止爬升到极端乐观的区域。期权交易中也出现了极端情况（根据SentimenTrader最近的研究成果），破产股票（垃圾股）的价格也大幅飙升（彭博社报道）。
