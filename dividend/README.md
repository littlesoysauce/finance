# TFSA, RRSP and Dividend
The RRSP offers greater tax benefits under the right circustances but the fact that you have to pay income taxes when you take out money from it makes it less flexible. The TFSA may not provide as many tax benefits as the RRSP, but since taking money out of it has no tax consequences, it's much more flexible.

## RRSP
RRSP contributions are tax-deductible. The contributions you make are deducted from your income for tax purposes. In other words, if you make $100,000 this year but add $10,000 to your RRSP throughout the year, you will be taxed as if you made $90,000 of income that year. Thanks to the tax deduction, if your income taxes are around 40%, you will be getting a ~$4000 tax reund after filing your taxes. However, since RRSP withdrawls are taxed like income, you will eventually pay taxes on the withdrawals, but at a lower tax rate in the future if your income is lower at reitrement than throughout your working years.
To use the RRSP properly, you need to make sure that your tax bracket is high when you are contributing ot it but that your tax bracket is low when you withdraw from it.

You should generally invest in an RRSP if:
* You are investing for retirement, and making more than 50,000 a year and don't expect your income to grow significantly.
* You are investing fro retirement and making over $90,000 a year.
* You are investing towards your first home, are making more than 50,000 a year, and plan to use your RRSP for a Home buyer's plan
* You are investing towards your education, are making more than $50,000 a year, and plan to use your RRSP for a lifelong learning plan

# TFSA
The TFSA is a simpler tool that allows your investment to grow tax-free but doesn't provide the tax-deduction benefits of the RRSP. It's ideal for objectives that are earlier than retirement but can also be used fro retirement in certain cases.

You should invest in a TFSA if:
* You are investing towards an objective that is sooner than retirement (a home, wedding, vacation, car, etc)
* You are investing for retirement and are making less than $50,000
* You are investing for retirement, are making more than $50,000, but expect your salary to go up significantly. Using a TFSA in this case allows you to use your RRSP contribution room later, when you are at a higher tax bracket, to take advantage of a greater tax deduction.

If an RRSP is right for you, consider maximizing your RRSP contributions to get a larger tax refund and put that refund into your TFSA
